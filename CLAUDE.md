# Working brief

FreeHarmony is a local, offline application for configuring Logitech Harmony remotes. **This
repository holds the product and none of the knowledge**: the reverse engineering, the specification
and the libraries live in [harmony-explorations](https://github.com/dannybloe/harmony-explorations),
checked out beside this one. Read its `README.md` and `docs/status.md` before working here, because
almost every question about what a config contains is answered there and nowhere else.

**Status: placeholder.** Two documents and a licence. The application starts once there is enough
format knowledge to build it on, and there nearly is: a config reads off a remote byte for byte, every
byte of it is attributed, and a config's devices, activities, button bindings and drawn screens all
come back by name. What is missing is this repository.

## The boundary, and the one rule that protects it

FreeHarmony **consumes** `@harmony/codec` and `@harmony/usb`. It does not reimplement them, and a hand
maintained copy of any of that code here is the one thing that must not happen. The reason is the other
repository's oldest rule: two copies of a derivation stay two copies right up until one of them moves,
which has happened there twice, and both times a test could see both copies. Across a repository
boundary no test can. So a finding could land there and never reach the product, which is the failure
this split is arranged to avoid.

If distribution ever demands vendoring, vendor a **generated** copy with a check that it matches a
commit. That is a dependency wearing a hat, not a second source.

**How it is consumed, today**: a path dependency on the sibling checkout, which is measured working.

```json
{ "dependencies": { "@harmony/codec": "file:../harmony-explorations/packages/codec" } }
```

So the sibling layout is load bearing rather than a convention. **Later**, when that API stops moving,
the libraries get published and this repository pins an exact version. A **git dependency was tried and
does not work**: Node refuses to strip types for any file inside `node_modules`, so a source only
package cannot be consumed that way on any version.

**The first thing to write here is not the interface.** It is that dependency plus one script that
opens a config and prints its inventory, so the boundary is proven before there is an Electron shell
to hide a problem in.

## Never write to a remote

Version 1 is read only, and the rails that enforce it live in `@harmony/usb`, not here: writes are
refused unless `HARMONY_ENABLE_WRITES=1`, an architecture with no write target refuses by
construction, and internal memory reads with an odd byte count are refused because they hang a remote.
A rail enforced by an interface is enforced until somebody writes a script, so this repository must
never reach past the library to a device, and must never grow its own copy of a rail.

These remotes are irreplaceable and Logitech's service can be withdrawn without notice. Treat every
hardware path as something that gets one chance.

## This repository is public, and it handles other people's equipment

* **No config or firmware binaries, ever**, including as test fixtures. A config is Logitech generated
  data with an infrared database compiled from Logitech's own, so it is a copyright matter; a remote's
  info output carries serial GUIDs, which is personal data. `.gitignore` lists them already, before
  there is a single fixture, because a fixture is the first thing anybody reaches for.
* **No screenshots of a real config's screens.** A drawn screen is a picture of somebody's equipment.
* **No brand names out of a contributor's config** in a document or a test. Counts and shapes.
* When this repository does start holding code with fixtures, bring over the other one's
  `bin/check-publishable.py` pre-commit hook, which checks **staged content** and so catches a rename
  or a `git add -f` that `.gitignore` misses.

## Conventions carried over

* **Every dependency pinned exactly. No `^`, no `~`, ever**, including transitive additions, and the
  lock file committed. This matters far more here than in a research repository: an Electron and
  interface stack is hundreds of packages, and retrofitting pinning is painful where starting pinned is
  free. Check what a dependency pulls in before adding it; an audit is the floor, not the check.
* **No em-dashes or en-dashes in documents.** Nothing enforces it here yet, so it is a habit rather
  than a check. Verify with a command written in escapes, so that the check does not itself contain
  the characters it looks for, which is a mistake made once already while writing this file:

  ```
  python3 -c "import sys; d=open(sys.argv[1]).read(); print(sum(d.count(c) for c in '\u2014\u2013'))" <file>
  ```
* **A claim carries its evidence.** The other repository's rule is that a confirmed fact lands as a
  structured fact, a written argument and a regression test. Product code is not a finding, but the
  spirit transfers: if this application states something about a remote, it should be able to say which
  section of `docs/findings.md` says so.

## Licence

GPLv3 for the application, MIT for the libraries it builds on. Plain GPLv3 rather than the Affero
variant on purpose, and `README.md` carries the argument: compatibility with concordance and
harmony-decompiler has to run in **both** directions, and Affero's extra clause covers software offered
over a network, which this application never does. Anything that grows a server later gets its own
licence decision at that point.
